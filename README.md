# Just Another Text Editor

## Description
This text editor application can be run in the browser or downloaded to use on your machine as a progressive web application. It uses indexDB to store your files locally and webpack to bundle the files. Because it uses indexDB, the text entered into this application will persist even if you are offline. If you download the repo to use, you have to run "npm run start" in your terminal to initialize the server. You can then enter text, close and reopen the page to see that your text persists. This project is deployed to heroku and can be found [here](https://lit-caverns-97353-16e931334f59.herokuapp.com).
